#    Expectations
    · Ensure your code is DRY.
    · Basic OOP should be used.
    · Apply various optimizations where necessary(e.g pagination).
    · Efficient SQL custom queries should be used where needed.
        o Joins
        o Views
    · Exception Handling
    · Custom response structure both on success and failure
    · All part of your code should be tested
    · Database design should be normalised and entities 
        should have necessary relationship mapping
    · Add timestamp to your tables where necessary
#
